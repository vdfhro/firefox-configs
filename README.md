A list of settings I use on firefox

## Disclaimer
I am not involved in the development of any of the software I mention here. This is simply a collection of settings I use for my browser. 

## Who is this for?
This is primarily for my own reference, but can be used as a guide to making firefox slightly more convenient to use than it is out of the box. Not all of these settings work for everybody, and I am happy to hear about modifications to this setup you believe will help me. 

## Basic Settings
- Make sure automatic updates are enabled for firefox.
- From the 'Home' category, disable snippets, recommended by pocket, recent activity and shortcuts.
- From the 'Search' category, uncheck 'Provide search suggestions'.
- Choose a privacy respecting search engine.  personally use Brave Search. 
- From the 'Privacy & Security' section, set Enhanced Tracking Protection to 'strict'. 
- Check 'Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed'.
- Uncheck 'Ask to save logins and passwords for websites'. Use Bitwarden or KeepassXC instead. 
- Check 'Always use private browsing mode'. 
- Uncheck everything in 'Firefox Data Collection and Use'. If you want to keep telemetry enabled, you can alter these settings accordingly.
- Uncheck 'Block dangerous and deceptive content'. This sends data to Google,but leave it enabled if it works for your threat model. 
- Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows.
